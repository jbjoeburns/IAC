# Why orchestration
Orchestration is essentially the practice of coordinating many processes in development at the same time.

Coordinating multiple processes at once automatically helps complete a range of tasks all at the same time, saving time.

# Why terraform
Terraform allows you to make many changes to configuration/deployment across a range of different cloud providers all at the same time, esentially completing a task that would take days or weeks, all at once.

Terraform specifically lets you plan your changes to infrastructure then review these before deploying them.

Additionally, you only need to define how you want your infrastructure to look in the end using your config files, so dont need to define a laborious step by step process.

Orcehstration with Terraform is a 3 step process. This first involves defining your infrastructure such as contents of configuration files. 

Then reviewing the changes to make sure the actions performed are to your specifications.

And finally, applying these changes across a range of different instances and cloud providers.
